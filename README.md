[LOST COMMITS] This is the third repo for the same project...so i lost my commits. but I paid attention to it so well that I committed all changes neatly.

[EXTRA DEPLOYMENT INFO]
 I did this project in angular 18 with ssr. I deployed it on vercel. It was good on a laptop, not good on my mobile. I searched for the error for hours, deployed several times, it was always fine on a laptop, never on a mobile phone. After many hours of trying and more and more deployments, I sent the link to my girlfriend so she could look at it to see if it works for her and it's just my phone that's bad. It was good for her, it was good for others. I bought my phone used 8 years ago. I'm going to buy a new phone now or my hair will fall out.
